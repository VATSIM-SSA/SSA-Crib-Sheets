  </li>
<li>You may also add an optional second page, as seen on the Cape Town crib sheet with a CTR overview of VRP entry and exit points. In addition, you may also add a Ground overview of the airfield parking positions and taxiways.</li>
  
  <li>Send the completed Crib sheet in .pub format to <a href="cribsheets@vatssa.com">cribsheets@vatssa.com</a></li>
